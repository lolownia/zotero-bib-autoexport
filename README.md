Zotero Bib Autoexport
=====================

This plugin for Zotero Standalone (i've not tested it on Zotero
plugin) exports the collection to a collection.bib file in Zotero
Resources directory (on Mac OS X it's
/Applications/Zotero.app/Contents/Resources/collection.bib).

The file is exported with every modification, waiting 15 seconds which
allows you to finish all the edits, if you edit multiple fields of a
record.

To do
=====
* Export collections to separate files
* Configure the output file
